## Pi-hole stuff

[Pi-hole time restrict block by group](https://github.com/lwsnz/pihole/tree/main/time-restrict-block-by-group)

Use case, restrict sites/hosts at bedtime defined hours via PiHole (unless you just turn off a seperate wifi SSID).


Info about PiHole if your new, visit https://docs.pi-hole.net/



----
## Hosts file

If you do not use pihole and rather just use Windows hosts file to filter safesearch or youtube safe etc. have a look at "windows-hosts-file" instead.

Other alternatives you could use besides a hosts file or pihole maybe like OpenDNS https://www.opendns.com/setupguide/#familyshield
