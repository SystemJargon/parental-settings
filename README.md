windows_logon_hours - restrict logon hours on Windows OS.

pihole-bedtime-restrict - restrict sites/hosts at bedtime defined hours via PiHole (unless you just turn off a seperate wifi SSID).

Info about PiHole if your new, visit https://docs.pi-hole.net/

If you do not use pihole and rather just use Windows hosts file to filter safesearch or youtube safe etc. have a look at "windows-hosts-file" instead.

Other alternatives you could use besides hosts file or pihole maybe like OpenDNS https://www.opendns.com/setupguide/#familyshield
