## Pi-hole stuff

[Pi-hole time restrict block by group](https://github.com/lz-eng/pi-hole/tree/main/time-restrict-block-by-group)


Use case, restrict sites/hosts at bedtime defined hours via PiHole (unless you just turn off a seperate wifi SSID).


Info about PiHole if your new, visit https://docs.pi-hole.net/



----

## Hosts file

If you do not use pihole and rather just use Windows hosts file to filter safesearch or youtube safe etc. have a look at [windows-hosts-file](https://github.com/lz-eng//windows-hosts-file) instead.


Other alternatives you could use besides a hosts file or pihole;

[OpenDNS](https://www.opendns.com/setupguide/#familyshield)
[NextDNS](https://nextdns.io)
