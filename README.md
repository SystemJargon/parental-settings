# parental-settings

windows_logon_hours - restrict logon hours

pihole-bedtime-restrict - restrict sites/hosts at bedtime defined hours (unless you just turn off a seperate wifi SSID).

If you do not use pihole and rather just use Windows hosts file to filter safesearch or youtube safe etc. have a look at "windows-hosts-file" instead.
